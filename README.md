# GAME-2023-GAME-ENGINE-II-Assignment
The assignment is to create an A.I. agent which follows a spline path using NavMesh for pathfinding, and a Behavior Tree to determine its next action.

The A.I. will have “moods” based on player interaction with it. eg. Scared, Worried, Calm. This mood will be apparent through an aura around the actor, that ranges in colour from Green (calm), Yellow (worried), Red (scared).
